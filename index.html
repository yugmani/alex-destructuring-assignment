    <li>
      <h3>What is destructuring?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Destructuring is a way to extract values from data and assign those
          values to one or more variables.
        </li>
        <li>Destructuring works only with arrays and objects.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There are two ways to use deconstructing.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, you can use it to assign a value to a variable when you declare
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, you can declare an empty variable and use destructuring later
          to assign it a value. When you want to use this, pay attention to the
          type of variable you use.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Destructuring arrays</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>First, you have to use syntax with square brackets [].</li>
        <li>
          Second, inside these square brackets, you specify the variable name(s)
          you want to use. When you specify the variables names, make sure you
          write them in the right order.
        </li>
        <li>
          Destructuring allows you to assign value that doesnâ€™t exist in the
          array
        </li>
        <li>
          If you access variables assigned to the values that doesn't exist in
          the array end up with undefined
        </li>
        <li>
          You can change the order of values being assigned by changing the
          order of variable names. With arrays, you can also skip values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Skipping values in arrays</h4>
          You can change the order of values being assigned by changing the
          order of variable names. With arrays, you can also skip values.
        </li>
        <li><h4>Arrays, destructuring and rest operator</h4></li>
      </ol>
